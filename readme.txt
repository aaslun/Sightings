Sightings lets you or your readers geo-tag any post or page in your WordPress site to display your blog posts on a Google map.

== Description ==

Why navigate your blog by search or menus? Display your blog on Google maps instead!
The purpose of Sightings is to allow you to link any of your post or page with a specific geographic location.
Sightings is an easy to use plug-in that utilizes the Google Maps v3 JavaScript API to let you geo-tag any post or page in your WordPress site.
Since version 1.3 you can even let your visitors submit their own geotagged places by dropping their own markers on the [sightings-map]!
Display all your recorded sightings on a larger map by using the shortcode: [sightings-map] on any post or page.

Example of situations where you'd find Sightings useful, if:

* you're blogging about UFO sightings and want to display the location where the UFO was seen
* you're reporting news and want to pin-point the location of main event in the story
* you're blogging about the latest trip you took to a city or a nice place where you've been on vacation
* you want to give directions to someone about something connected to what you are writing

You can surely come up with other useful ways to use Sightings!

Requirements:

* PHP 5.3 or later

Features:

* Easy to get started, easy to use
* Geo-tag any post or page
* Display the geo-tag on a Google map that can be viewed on the post
* Display all recorded geo-tags collectively on a larger map by typing the shortcode: [sightings-map] into any post or page
* Multiple language support (English, Swedish)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use this plugin? =

Once you have installed and activated the plugin, create a new post. Scroll down a bit until you see the map meta-box.
Click and drag the marker to a desired position on the map.
Click the "Use" button.

View the post, the map should now be displayed at the bottom of your post, above the comments.

On any post or page, type in the text: [sightings-map]
Publish the post or page.
On the published page a map will now appear that allows your visitors to contribute geotagged locations along with some descriptive text and user information.
Click on the "[+] Contribute with a location" link at the bottom of the map. A marker will appear. Drag it to desired location. Click it and enter location information. Click "Submit".
Every submission is imported into your blog as a drafted post, awaiting your approval. Just change the post status to "published" if you want it to appear publicly on your blog along with your other sightings.
It is highty recommended that you configure the Sightings settings in admin first. Here you can also choose to recieve e-mails when someone submits a new sighting through the form.

First, make sure that you have created some posts, positioned and saved the geolocations on the maps.
Otherwise the map will be empty.
Create a new post/page.
In the text meta-box, type in the text: [sightings-map]
Save/publish the post/page.
View the post/page.

= Can I filter out markers by category on the larger map? =

Yes, just enter the [sightings-map] attribute cat_slug or cat_id for the category you want to display on the map.
This will only fetch and display sightings markers for the provided category on the [sightings-map].
For example: [sightings-map cat_id="3"] ,will display only sightings that have the category with id 3.
